# 🐢 Turtle Race Game – Day 17 (Angela Yu Python Bootcamp)

A fun and interactive Python game built using the **Turtle graphics module**, where players bet on which turtle will win a race. Each turtle moves forward randomly, making every race unpredictable and exciting.

This project is part of **Day 17** of **Angela Yu’s 100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp** and focuses on object-oriented programming, loops, user input, and event-driven logic.

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Create a graphical racing game using Python
- Practice working with **classes and objects**
- Understand **randomized behavior**
- Learn how to handle **user input through GUI popups**
- Implement game logic using loops and conditionals

---

## 🕹️ How the Game Works

1. The screen opens with six turtles at the starting line.
2. The user places a bet by entering a turtle color.
3. The race begins once a bet is placed.
4. Each turtle moves forward a random distance.
5. The first turtle to cross the finish line wins.
6. The program checks if the user’s bet matches the winning turtle.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Python Turtle Graphics
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Lists and loops
- Random number generation
- User input via `screen.textinput()`
- Conditional logic

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the project files.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py


Enter your bet when prompted and watch the race begin!
